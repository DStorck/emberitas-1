<p>There are a just couple of steps you’ll need to take to install
  Ember-CLI on your computer so that you can create your own applications
  using Ember.js. Your workshop experience will be much smoother if you
  install Ember before arriving on Saturday morning!
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If, at any point during this installation, you encounter an issue,
      please email
      <a href="mailto:installations@emberitas.com">installations@emberitas.com</a>
      and we’ll attempt to work you through it! Computers are finnicky, so don't
      get discouraged.
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>We’ll also have a volunteer posted up at
      <strong>Opa’s on South Lamar</strong>
      on
      <strong>Thursday night</strong>
      from 5pm - 8pm-ish to help any interested attendees with their
      installation. Please email <a href="mailto:installations@emberitas.com">installations@emberitas.com</a> to let
      us know you’ll be stopping by.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additional assistance will be available on Saturday morning at
      the workshop from 8:30am to 9:45am. As there are limited volunteer
      resources available, please attempt to leave this option as a last
      resort!
    </p>

</ul>

<h3 id="but-first-what-is-ember-cli">But first: What is Ember-CLI?</h3>

<p>
  Ember provides developers like you with tools and resources that make
  creating and deploying “ambitious web applications” quite simple.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>CLI</strong> stands for “Command Line Interface.”
  If you’ve ever created a new file by typing something like
  “touch new_file.txt” in your Terminal, then you’ve used a command
  line interface. If you haven’t, that’s cool - we’ll teach you a
  little bit about the power of controlling your computer by the
  command line at our workshop. You’ll also get a bit of experience
  by following this tutorial. If you want to learn more about the
  Command Line now, check out
  <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line">
    this Code Academy course
  </a>.
</p>

<p>From the Ember.js documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ember.js makes it downright simple to create sophisticated, multi-page
    JavaScript applications with great URL support, in a fraction of the code
    you’d write in other frameworks.
    (<a href="http://emberjs.com/">http://emberjs.com/</a>)

<h3 id="ember-installation-instructions">Ember Installation Instructions</h3>



<h4 id="1-open-a-terminal-instance-on-your-computer">1. Open a Terminal Instance on Your Computer</h4>

<p>
  On Mac, this application is simply called “Terminal.”
  Hit “Command” and “Space at the same time to Spotlight search
  for Terminal, then select it to open the application.
</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="2-install-xcode">2. Install XCode</h4>

<p>
  On Mac computers, you’ll need to stop right now (thank you very much)
  and
  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">
    install Xcode from the Apple App store
  </a>.
</p>

<p>
  It’s absolutely essential that you install XCode or none of the rest
  of this process will work! For those of you who already have it
  installed, this is a great time to make sure that it’s updated.
  While no less annoying than iTunes updates (what are they even
  updating, for real?!?), XCode updates should actually be done from
  time to time.  :)
</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="3-install-homebrew">3. Install Homebrew</h4>

<p>
  <a href="http://brew.sh/">
    <strong>Homebrew</strong>
  </a>
  is a <strong>package manager</strong> for Mac.
  <strong>Packages</strong> are reusable code modules - big or small -
  that developers can create, share, and use to make their lives easier.
  We’ll install several packages using Homebrew in this tutorial,
  including <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>npm</strong>, and
  <strong>ember-cli</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  To install Homebrew on your computer, copy and paste this into your
  terminal:
</p>

<p>
  <code>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</code>
</p>

<p>This tells your computer to use Ruby (already installed on your
  computer - yay!) to execute (-e) the download of Homebrew, located at the
  https:// address shown above.
</p>

<p>It will take several minutes, so take a quick break.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="4-install-nodejs">4. Install Node.js</h4>

<p>
  <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">
    <strong>Node.js</strong>
  </a> is an open-source project for developing server-side Web applications
  using Javascript. Node also maintains a project called
  <strong>npm</strong>, which stands for
  <strong>node package manager</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Ember-cli is an npm package, which is why we need to make sure we have node
  installed before we do anything else.
</p>

<p>
  If you’re not sure whether you have node installed, you can type this into
  your terminal prompt:
</p>

<p>
  <code>node --version</code>
</p>

<p>
  If you get something like v0.0.10 back, feel free to continue to the next
  step. Otherwise, let’s take a moment to install Node.js.
  In your terminal window:
</p>

<p>
  <code>brew install node</code>
</p>

<p>and wait.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="5-install-npm">5. Install npm</h4>

<p>In your terminal window:</p>

<p>
  <code>brew install npm</code>
</p>

<p>and wait.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="6-install-ember-cli">6. Install ember-cli</h4>

<p>Now you’re ready to install ember-cli.</p>

<p>In your terminal window: </p>

<p>
  <code>npm install -g ember-cli@2.6.2</code>
</p>

<p>The -g means that we’re installing ember-cli
  <strong>globally</strong>.
  That means that after you install ember-cli, you’ll be able to instantiate
  new ember-cli projects in almost any folder on your computer, and they’ll
  all use this latest version of ember-cli.
</p>

<p>This will take a bit of time because ember-cli has a number of
  <strong>dependencies</strong>
  (other packages that the ember-cli package needs to install to make
  ember-cli whole).
</p>

<p>After your Terminal stops logging the installation process, we can check
  that ember installed properly.
</p>

<p>
  <code>ember -v</code>
</p>

<p>(-v is a shortcut for —version that we saw above. Both of these
  <strong>flags</strong>
  do the same exact thing, but using -v saves you seven characters. Try it!)
</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="7-install-bower">7. Install Bower</h4>

<p><code>npm install -g bower</code></p>

<p>
  You’re getting good at this, so I bet you know what to do with that command
  above. (Copy and paste it into your terminal!)
</p>

<p>What’s Bower? It’s a package manager (kind of like NPM) but for
  <strong>front-end</strong> packages.
</p>

<p>Front-end, back-end — what’s the difference? To simplify it,
  let’s just say that the front-end is everything you can see when you go
  to www.facebook.com (ex. the logo, the font size and color, the way the
  ‘like’ number increments instantly when you click on the thumbs up button),
  while the back-end is everything you AREN’T seeing
  (ex. when Facebook checks to see if your password is correct or incorrect,
  the algorithm Facebook uses to decide what’s ‘Trending’ or
  ‘People You May Know).
</p>

<p>We install all of these things using npm because the internet is a
  beautiful and scary place where we simultaneously trust and do-not-trust
  everyone. (But we can talk about that some other time…)
</p>

<p>
  You can <code>bower -v</code> or <code>`bower —version</code> to make sure
  bower is installed on your computer.
</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="8-install-phantomjs">8. Install Phantom.js</h4>

<p>To complete you ember-cli install, let’s install phantom.js.</p>

<p>Phantom.js helps us run the <strong>automated tests</strong> in Ember.</p>

<p>Testing our code is really important because - as mentioned earlier -
  the internet is a scary and beautiful place where anyone can write code and
  let dozens, hundreds, or millions of other people use it as an application.
  So we want it to work, and work well.
</p>

<p>Automated tests are <a href="http://thebomb.com">thebomb.com</a> (well done, Chive. well done.)
  because it means that, as developers, product managers, marketers,
  and sales people, we can spend more time doing our job and less time
  making sure that our websites work the way we built them.
</p>

<p>
  See if it all works:
</p>

<p>
  <code>ember new the-greatest-app-ever-built</code>
</p>

<p>
  When you copy and paste this into your Terminal window, you’re
  <em>initializing</em> your very first Ember application into existence.
  Congratulations!
</p>

<p>
  This creates a new folder inside of the folder you are currently in,
  aptly named ‘the-greatest-app-ever-built’. But, like, how do you get to it?
</p>

<p>
  Now, let’s “change directories” (cd) into our new application folder. In your terminal:
</p>

<p>
  <code>cd the-greatest-app-ever-built</code>
</p>

<p>and now you are officially inside of your application!</p>

<p>In your terminal:</p>

<p>
  <code>ember s</code>
</p>

<p>and you should see your computer working hard to start up a
  <strong>local server</strong> running your application.
</p>

<p>Open up a web browser, and go to</p>

<p>
  <code>localhost:4200</code>
</p>

<p>
  You should see a nice “Welcome to Ember” page. Success!
</p>

<h4 id="9-install-the-ember-inspector">9. Install The Ember Inspector</h4>

<p>The last thing we need to install is the
  <strong>Ember Inspector</strong>.
  The Ember inspector is a powerful browser addon that helps us <em>debug</em>
  (developer speak for ‘finding and fixing problems’) our Ember application. <br>
 This requires that you’ve installed  Google Chrome or Firefox. The instructors
 will be using Chrome at the workshop, so that’s the recommended install:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Chrome: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi">Install Ember Inspector</a>. (RECOMMENDED)</li>
<li>For Firefox: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ember-inspector/">Install Ember Inspector</a>.</li>
</ul>
