  <h1> About Emberitas </h1>
  <div class="about">
    Emberitas is a free one-day workshop to teach women Ember.js. The two-track workshop includes a course for women who are new to code (and will focus on principles of MVC and object-oriented programming through the lens of Ember.js) as well as an intermediate track for women who are already familiar with a backend or frontend MVC framework and want to learn more about what Ember.js has to offer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Why we're we doing this:</h2>
    <br>
    The Ember community is uniquely welcoming, supportive, and genuine. As just one example of how Ember stands out among tech communities, 33% of EmberConf 2016 speakers were women.
    However, EmberATX’s female meetup attendance is pretty dismal!
    <br>
    <br>

    As a community, we’re actively looking for ways to fix this and we realized we simply need more Ember developers in Austin.
    When women find welcoming communities in tech, they stay in the industry longer.
    <br>
    <br>

    That’s why an event like Emberitas is so important, and why we're excited to see you there on July 16th, 2016.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Why we're prioritizing women:</h2>
    <br>
    As a community, we're actively looking for ways to be inclusive to those that feel intimidated attending local meet ups and hackathons due to a lack of women. We are striving to create an environment that is conducive to learning and welcoming regardless of your tech expertise or gender.
    <br>
    <br>
    We encourage interested men to join the waitlist. If there are spots in the workshop that have not been claimed by July 9, we will begin offering seats to men and women on the waitlist in the order in which they signed up.
    <br><br>
    All members of the Ember community are encouraged to support Emberitas and diversity in the community through volunteering and giving lightning talks during an event.
