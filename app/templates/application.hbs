  <h1>Is it Women Only&#63;</h1>
  <div class="about">
    Women are given priority for workshop seats at this event. We encourage interested men to join the waitlist. If there are spots in the workshop that have not been claimed by July 9, we will begin offering seats to men and women on the waitlist in the order in which they signed up.
    <br>
    <br>
    As a community, we're actively looking for ways to be inclusive to those that feel intimidated attending local meet ups and hackathons due to a lack of women. We are striving to create an environment that is conducive to learning and welcoming regardless of your tech expertise or gender.
    <br>
    <br>
    We encourage men to become Emberitas supporters in the community by lending their knowledge through volunteering and giving lightning talks during an event.
